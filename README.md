## Lecture 5:

Decisions

1. css class names should be camelCase
2. import ordering
   - external libs
   - internal modules
   - css
3. FIXME: Should we document all exported classes, functions ? What about public methods ?
4. FIXME: Should we make some DesignDecisions regarding naming (Some suffixes would be nice...e.g. Component, Service, Store,...whatever) ?
5. FIXME: Should we use Component if we're not using any method from lifecycle ?
6. {/_ FIXME: Should we think to collect translations at least into single file... _/}
7. /\*
   FIXME: Should we transform it into following according to our discussion or? :
   class EquipmentServiceType {}
   const equipmentService = new EquipmentServiceType();
   export default equipmentService;

\*/

8. // FIXME: Should we have central place for managing history actions ?
9. // FIXME: ~100 lines needed only for JSX stuff... hmmm let's discuss
10. // FIXME: This method is deprecated...let's discuss how to solve it in different way...
